\abstract{
We present an algorithm, called SHREC,
for constructing isosurfaces with sharp edges and features.
Algorithm SHREC computes isosurface vertex locations on sharp features,
selects a well-spaced subset of these vertices,
and merges isosurface vertices in the neighborhood of each selected vertex.
The resulting isosurfaces have good representations of sharp features.
Algorithm SHREC is similar to a previous algorithm, MergeSharp,
but improves on MergeSharp
by better generation of isosurface vertices,
better selections of vertices on sharp features
and better choices in merging.
We also define a function to measure the closeness 
of the normals between two surfaces
and use this function to evaluate the quality of reconstructions
of surfaces with sharp features.}
