A grid edge is {\em bipolar} if one of its endpoints has scalar value
less the isovalue while another has scalar values greater than
or equal to the isovalue.
A grid cube is {\em active} if one of its edges is bipolar.

A fold in a mesh is a mesh edge $\eb$ with dihedral angle near zero,
so that the two mesh triangles incident on $\eb$ are almost positioned
on top of one another.
