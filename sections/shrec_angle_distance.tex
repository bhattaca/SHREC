\section{Measuring Angular Distance between Surfaces}
\label{section:angular_distance}

As described in Section~\ref{section:related},
we evaluated MergeSharp in~\cite{bw-cisec-13}
by extracting sharp mesh edges (dihedral angle less than $140^\circ$)
and comparing the 1-skeleton formed
by those sharp edges with the 1-skeleton of the sharp edges 
in an ideal surface.
We present here a different way of evaluating 
a reconstructed mesh containing sharp features.
