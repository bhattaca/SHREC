A grid edge, facet or cube is {\em active} if it contains at least one vertex 
with scalar value greater than or equal to the isovalue
and at least one vertex with scalar value less than the isovalue.

A fold in a mesh is a mesh edge $\eb$ with dihedral angle near zero,
so that the two mesh triangles incident on $\eb$ are almost positioned
on top of one another. (See Figure~\ref{fig:problems}(d).)
