\subsection{Synthetic Scalar and Gradient Data}
\label{section:synthetic}

To measure the quality of our reconstruction,
we used a number of synthetic scalar and gradient data sets.
Given a point $p$,
let $f^{L_1}_{p}(q)$ be the $L_1$ distance from $p$ to $q$.
A Cube data set is generated by sampling $f^{L_1}_p$
and its gradients on vertices of the regular grid.

Level sets of $f^{L_1}_p$ are cubes whose edges are
parallel to the coordinate axes
and whose facets are orthogonal to those axes.
By rotating $f^{L_1}_p$ around $p$, 
we can generate a scalar field whose level sets are cubes
that are not axis-aligned.
By taking the minimum of two (rotated) scalar fields, 
$f^{L_1}_p$ and $f^{L_1}_{p'}$, 
centered around two different points, $p$ and $p$', respectively,
we get a scalar field whose level sets are the boundaries
of the unions of the two cubes.
We call such data sets TwoCubes and use them 
with various rotations as test sets.

Let $\ell$ be a line.
Let $f^C_{\ell}(q)$ be the Euclidean distance from point $q$ to $\ell$.
The level sets of $f^C_{\ell}(q)$ are infinite cylinders around $\ell$.
Let $\fCII_{\ell,r}(q)$ equal $|f^C_{\ell}(q) - r|$.
The level sets of $\fCII_{\ell,r}(q)$  are pairs of infinite cylinders
at equal distances from the cylinder of radius $r$ around $\ell$.
Let $\fPII_{p,\ell}(q)$ be the distance from $q$ to the plane 
that contains point $p$ and is orthogonal to $\ell$.
Let $f^A_{p,\ell,r}(q)$ be the maximum 
of $\fCII_{\ell,r}(q)$ and of $\fPII_{p,\ell}(q)$.
The level sets are the boundaries of thickened annuli.

The width of the thickened annuli defined by $f^A_{p,\ell,r}$
equals their height.
We can adjust change the difference between the width and height
by adding a constant $c$ to $\fCII_{\ell,r}$.
Let $f^A_{p,\ell,r,c}(q)$ be the maximum 
of $\fCII_{\ell,r}(q)+c$ and of $\fPII_{p,\ell}(q)$.
If $c$ is positive, then the height is $c$ units greater than the width.
If $c$ is negative, then the height is $c$ units less than the width.

Define $f^F_{p,\ell,r,c}(q)$ as the minimum
of $f^A_{p,\ell,r,c}(q)$ and $f^A_{p,\ell,r,-c}(q)$.
The level sets of $f^F_{p,\ell,r,c}(q)$ are the boundaries
of the unions of two thickened annuli.
One annuli has height $c$ units greater than its width
while the other has height $c$ units less than its width.
A Flange data set is a regular grid sampling of $f^F_{p,\ell,r,c}(q)$. 
We use the Flange data sets as test sets.
