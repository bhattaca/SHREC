\maketitle

Our paper contains the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We describe sharp vertex generation and selection steps
in SHREC which result in substantially better sets of sharp vertices
than those produced by MergeSharp.
We discuss why this set of vertices is better.
\item We describe merging steps in SHREC
which avoid constructing degenerate or small angle triangles and
avoid flipping triangles,
problems which occur in MergeSharp.
\item We define the ``Angular Distance'' between two surfaces
and use this distance to evaluate the quality 
of surface reconstruction algorithms.
\end{enumerate}
