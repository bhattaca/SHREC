\label{section:conclusion}

Our goal in designing SHREC was to produce a mesh
which represents 1-dimensional features by a sequence
of sharp mesh edges and 0-dimensional features by sharp vertices.
Perhaps this requirement is overly severe.
Why can't 1-dimensional features be represented by a few small polygons
instead of single edges?
Why shouldn't 1-dimensional features be represented 
as very high curvature regions instead of as non-smooth regions 
where the surface normals are discontinuous?
